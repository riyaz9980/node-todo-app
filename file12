Got it 👍 You want to **delete credentials** from Jenkins.

Here’s how you can do it:

### 🔧 Steps to Delete Credentials in Jenkins

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** from the left sidebar.
2. Select **Credentials**.
3. Choose the right **domain** (usually `Global` unless you created a custom one).
4. You’ll see the list of stored credentials (like the ones in your dropdown: `riyaz/****`, `docker9980277/****`, etc.).
5. Click on the **credential ID** you want to remove.
6. On that page, click **Delete** (red button).

⚠️ Important:

* If the credential is used in a pipeline or agent configuration, deleting it will break that job until you reconfigure with another valid credential.

Do you want me to also give you the **CLI command** way to delete Jenkins credentials, in case you prefer terminal over UI?
